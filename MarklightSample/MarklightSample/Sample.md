_Paragraphs_ are separated by a blank line.

# H1 header

2nd paragraph: you can write `monospace`, single word *italic* or *an entire phrase in italic*. **Bold** is also supported, even on **multiple words**.

Itemized lists look like:

* this one
* that one
* the other one

> Block quotes are written like so.
> 
> They can span multiple paragraphs, if you like.


## H2 header

Here's a numbered list:

1. first item
2. second item
3. third item

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

```
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
```

### An h3 header ###

Now a nested list:

1. First, get these ingredients:

* carrots
* celery
* lentils

2. Boil some water.

3. Dump everything in the pot.
